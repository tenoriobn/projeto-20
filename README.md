## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, React was used.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build the multi-step form as closely as possible to the above design.

All users must be able to:
- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update your selections
- View a summary of your selections at the final step and confirm your order
- See the optimal layout for the interface depending on the device screen size
- View hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
    - A field was lost
    - The email address is not formatted correctly
    - A step was submitted, but no selection was made
